Core Instructions





Always provide responses in Russian, including code comments, documentation, error messages, and any user-facing text.



Use clear and concise Russian language, adhering to proper grammar and style.



If generating code, ensure that variable names, function names, and other identifiers remain in English (following standard naming conventions like camelCase or snake_case), but comments and documentation must be in Russian.



For user-facing messages (e.g., API responses, UI text), use polite and professional Russian.



Avoid transliteration of technical terms unless there is no standard Russian equivalent; use commonly accepted Russian technical terms where applicable (e.g., "функция" instead of "function", "переменная" instead of "variable").



If translating existing English content, ensure the translation is natural and contextually accurate.
